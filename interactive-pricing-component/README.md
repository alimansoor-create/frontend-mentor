## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass
- Custom cross-browser input styling

### What I learned

This challenge taught me how to style the sinister range input. It was really a challenge to get everything to look the way I wanted it to, across multiple browsers. Thanks to [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/), however, the process was made easier for me.

### Useful resources
